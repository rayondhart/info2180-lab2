    <h2>You're Not Alone: Coping With Endometriosis</h2>
    <h4> July 10, 2023 by Victoria Pelham</h4>

    <p>Medical gaslighting can keep women in the dark about their own bodies and make them think they are broken, an impression Lindsey said commonly follows patients well into adulthood.
        "Having debilitating periods that keep you from everyday life is not normal," explained Kelly Wright, MD, associate professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology and division director of Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Surgery at Cedars-Sinai. “Find a doctor who takes it seriously. And if your doctor doesn't, get a second opinion, because we don't want you to face a lifetime of pain nobody’s dealt with, resulting in worse problems.”
        
        Diagnosing endometriosis is also medically challenging, she added, because blood tests do not exist, and different types of endometriosis are not always visible using existing imaging options. Furthermore, the disease is poorly understood and understudied, with little funding.</p>

        <h2>A Soulful Practice: Moving From Results-Driven towards Authentic Marketing</h2>
        <h4>September 29, 2023 by George Kao</h4>
        <img src="https://wearebrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Authentic-Content-Marketing-4-1.jpg">
        <p>With a results-driven mindset, we forget that marketing that is *creative* (by definition: doing something new) cannot accurately predict the ROI (return on investment).

            The illusion is that you can market something unique (like your work!) and expect specific results: that you should be able to send a cleverly-copywritten email and get X dollars in sales. You should be able to advertise for X dollars and get Y dollars in revenue.
            
            An authentic business does not work in such predictable ways, at first.
            
            The reliable systems and predictable investments are built eventually, but even those will need continual updating to remain authentic and of real service.
            
            This is the path, and price of authenticity and deep fulfillment.
            
            We first commit to the practice of authentic creativity and heartfelt service. Then we continually tweak our systems and processes to express (even more truthfully) our whole self and our love for our audience and work.</p>
